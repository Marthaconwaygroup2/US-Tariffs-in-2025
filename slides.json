        "Slide 1 explanation: The US is implementing a 10% tariff on all imports. This policy is expected to have several measurable economic effects:\n\nGDP Contraction: We're projecting a 0.3% contraction in US GDP for the first quarter of 2025. This suggests the tariffs may slow economic growth initially as businesses and consumers adjust to higher prices.\n\nHousehold Impact: The average household can expect to incur an additional cost of approximately $3,800 per year (in 2024 dollars). This reflects the pass-through effect of tariffs on consumer goods and potentially other economic factors like reduced competition.\n\nThese figures suggest the tariffs will create economic headwinds, though they might be intended to protect specific domestic industries or address trade imbalances. The world map graphic with tariff arrows implies these effects won't be confined to the US—they'll create ripple effects across global trade relationships and supply chains.",
        
        "Slide 2 explanation: This slide provides an executive summary of the US tariffs in 2025. The key highlights include a projected US GDP impact of -0.3% in Q1 2025, marking the first economic contraction in three years. The projected price increases are estimated at 2.3% on average for consumers due to the tariffs. The slide also mentions the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, which include a baseline 10% tariff on all imports effective from April 5, 2025. Additional tariffs are imposed on specific countries, with China facing 145% total duties. The automotive sector is subject to 25% tariffs, though there is partial relief through domestic production credits. Retaliatory tariffs are expected from China (125%), Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Japan. PWBM projects a 6% reduction in long-run GDP and a 5% reduction in wages as a result of these measures. The slide concludes with a quote emphasizing the double-edged nature of tariffs and their potential to breed fragmentation in the future.",
        
        "Slide 3 explanation: This slide outlines the methodology used in the research.

        "Slide 15 explanation: This slide provides a conclusion on the long-term outlook and system-level implications of the tariffs. It includes a graph showing long-term GDP projections for the United States, China, EU, and Mexico, illustrating the impact of tariffs on each economy compared to a global no-tariff scenario. The slide summarizes the key takeaways, including the immediate economic impact (0.3% GDP contraction in Q1 2025, -1.1pp lower growth for the full year), uneven sectoral effects (auto industry facing $2,000-$12,000 per vehicle cost increases, technology sector confronting $1B+ in equipment tariffs), global trade realignment (trade flows shifting to regional blocs, China pursuing deeper integration with EU and ASEAN), and supply chain transformation (65% of companies moving production to allied nations, accelerating the friendshoring trend above reshoring). A quote emphasizing the double-edged nature of tariffs is also featured.",
        
        "Slide 16 explanation: This slide concludes the presentation by contrasting the short-term protectionist aspects of tariffs with their long-term fragmentation effects. It includes a graph showing the long-term GDP projections for the United States, China, and the EU, illustrating the varying growth trajectories. The slide highlights the key takeaways, such as the immediate economic impact (0.3% GDP contraction in Q1 2025), uneven sectoral effects (auto and technology sectors facing significant cost increases), global trade realignment (formation of regional trading blocs, China-EU economic ties deepening), and supply chain transformation (65% of companies adopting friendshoring strategies). A final quote reinforces the idea that tariffs may lead to fragmentation in the future, with the text: 'Tariffs are a double-edged sword—protectionism today may breed fragmentation tomorrow.' The slide also notes that the 2025 tariff regime represents a profound shift in global trade policy that will likely reshape supply chains for decades to come, with some domestic sectors benefiting from protection while most face higher costs and uncertainty."
