        "Slide 1 explanation: The US is implementing a 10% tariff on all imports. This policy is expected to have several measurable economic effects:\n\nGDP Contraction: We're projecting a 0.3% contraction in US GDP for the first quarter of 2025. This suggests the tariffs may slow economic growth initially as businesses and consumers adjust to higher prices.\n\nHousehold Impact: The average household can expect to incur an additional cost of approximately $3,800 per year (in 2024 dollars). This reflects the pass-through effect of tariffs on consumer goods and potentially other economic factors like reduced competition.\n\nThese figures suggest the tariffs will create economic headwinds, though they might be intended to protect specific domestic industries or address trade imbalances. The world map graphic with tariff arrows implies these effects won't be confined to the USâ€”they'll create ripple effects across global trade relationships and supply chains.",
